## Automatic-Certificate-Generator

This python script automatically generates certificate by using a certificate template and csv file which contains the list of names to be printed on certificate. It downloads the certificate in the directory i.e. in **pictures** folder where the scripts are there.

## Installation

First of all install [python]("https://www.python.org/downloads/") on your system.
```bash
pip install PI
pip install Pandas
pip install pillow
```

## Procedure


I successfully created a Python script to automate the generation of workshop certificates for ISTE participants. This project aimed to streamline the tedious and time-consuming manual certificate generation process.

Workflow and functionality:
By leveraging Python programming, the script takes a list of workshop participants as input. It then utilizes this data to dynamically generate customized certificates for each individual. Additionally, the script incorporates a unique serial code generation mechanism to ensure the authenticity and individuality of each certificate.

Relevance of the project:
The project aligns with the needs of ISTE and other organizations conducting workshops. It simplifies the administrative workload by automating the certificate generation process, freeing up valuable time and resources.

Technical skills utilized:
Throughout the development of this project, I applied my expertise in Python programming. I employed fundamental concepts such as file handling, data manipulation, and string formatting. Furthermore, I demonstrated proficiency in generating unique serial codes, ensuring the security and uniqueness of each certificate.
